# Project Assumptions

## 1. Core Project Scope

### 1.1 POC Nature
- This is an AI-assisted Engineering Proof of Concept (POC)
- Implementation is focused on demonstrating architectural patterns and integration capabilities
- Not intended for production deployment without further review and enhancement
- Serves as a reference implementation for future AI-assisted development

### 1.2 Mock Integration
- **ClearCompany and Paylocity APIs are fully mocked**
  - No actual integration with real ClearCompany ATS
  - No actual integration with real Paylocity Headcount Planning Tool
  - All API responses are simulated
  - Mock data stored in DynamoDB
  - Events simulated through EventBridge

### 1.3 Mock API Implementation
- Mock APIs implement expected behavior patterns
- Data persistence through DynamoDB
- Simulated latency and error scenarios
- Webhook simulation via EventBridge
- No real external API calls

### 1.4 POC Limitations
- Implementation limited to core integration patterns
- Focus on serverless architecture demonstration
- Emphasis on code organization and best practices
- Limited to demonstration of key technical concepts
- Not all production features implemented

## 2. Scope Assumptions

### 2.1 Integration Scope
- Only requisition and headcount planning data flows demonstrated
- Historical data migration not included
- Only active requisitions handled
- Batch processing not implemented

### 2.2 Feature Limitations
- Maximum of 100 concurrent API requests
- Maximum payload size of 6MB
- Requisition updates limited to once per minute
- Maximum of 1000 custom fields per requisition

### 2.3 User Access
- All users have the same level of access (no role-based access in PoC)
- Authentication handled via API keys only
- No user management system required
- Single tenant architecture

## 3. Technical Assumptions

### 3.1 Mock API Assumptions
- Mock ClearCompany API:
  - Simulates RESTful API patterns
  - Implements expected JSON structures
  - Simulates webhook events
  - Implements basic rate limiting
  - Stores data in DynamoDB

- Mock Paylocity API:
  - Simulates RESTful API patterns
  - Implements expected JSON structures
  - Simulates webhook events
  - Implements basic rate limiting
  - Stores data in DynamoDB

### 3.2 Data Assumptions
- All dates in ISO 8601 format
- All monetary values in USD
- Text fields limited to 1000 characters
- IDs generated for mock data
- No data encryption required at field level
- Data retention period of 90 days
